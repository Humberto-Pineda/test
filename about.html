        Hailing from Southern California, Humberto enjoys hiking,
        paddleboarding and swimming in his free time with his friends. He has a trusty
        canine companion named Noble. He takes Noble with him on all his hikes. He is the
        eldest of five brothers, so all his life, he's been kept busy. He's traveled the world and
        captured many memories with his trusty camera. Next on his todo list? Be the best
        software engineer he can be!

      <p>I was an Air Traffic Controller for the US Marine Corps. I enjoyed my time in the service, but I always felt the was something missing in my role. Though I can't paint or play music, I've always wanted an outlet for my creative energy. I've been lucky to have found software development. It matches my creativity with my love for puzzle-solving and tinkering. I would like to find a role in the tech industry that keeps to that spirit. If I can have a chance to make a positive impact in the world, even better.</p>
